# ephemeraltabs

**ephemeraltabs** is a lightweight Firefox extension that helps you manage your open tabs by automatically closing those (except pinned tabs) that have been inactive for a configurable period of time. This helps prevent browser clutter, improves performance, and promotes efficient tab management.

## Features

- **Pinned Tabs Protection**: Pinned tabs remain unaffected and will not be closed automatically.
- **Lightweight**: Designed to be resource-efficient and minimize impact on browser performance.
- (TODO) **Configurable Time Limit**: Allows you to configure the time (in minutes, hours, or days) after which inactive tabs should be closed.
- (TODO) **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily set up and manage the extension through a simple settings interface.
